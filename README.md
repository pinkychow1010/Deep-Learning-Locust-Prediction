# DeepLearning_LocustPrediction
This is the EAGLE M.Sc. semester group project for **[Deep Learning class](http://eagle-science.org/project/met4-advanced-programming-for-remote-sensing-and-gis/)**

### Predicting Locust Swarm in Ethiopia using Environmental and Climate Data
This project uses climate variables as the predictors for the occurence of locust outbreak in Ethiopia. Owing to the dependency of locust behaviors on weather condition, instead of average climate variables, weather parameters before and during the month of outbreak is considered to improve the accuracy of prediction.

Predictors: Raw spectral signals (present and historical), Temperature(Landsat 8 Thermal Band/ WorldClim) â€“ at the month of outbreak and in the previous time points, 
Precipatation(present and historical), DEM, SMI (soil moisture), MODIS, wind direction, and Land use.
